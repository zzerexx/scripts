# Universal Chams
~~works on most games  
does not work with custom character models (strucid, phantom forces, etc)  
**ONLY** works if players are not in a folder (in Workspace)  
if u want the colors to be based on teamcolor, use the team check version  
chams do not apply to newly spawned players~~  
dont even use this shit is so bad  
it was experimental anyway
