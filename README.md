# Universal Aimbot  
Updated November 12, 2021  
v1.1.9  
```
https://pastebin.com/raw/nwqE7v07
```  
  
## Update v1.1.9  
Added Aim Assist  
Whats different between low-strength aimbot and aim assist?  
- Aim Assist has a minimum and maximum fov circle (when the player is within the minimum fov, it stops assisting)  
- You can make aim assist weaker than aimbot for more "legit" gameplay  
- When your mouse hovers over a player, it slows your sensitivity for more precise accuracy (you can disable this of course)
